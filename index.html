        We've all seen it, and most people are generally aware that its
        appearance changes according to a periodic cycle. But a peek at
        common Google searches suggests that our nearest celestial neighbor
        is frequently misunderstood.

        What I find exciting is that the answers to 70% of these questions
        lie in a basic understanding of the geometry of the Sun-Earth-Moon
        relationship, so that is what I will attempt to illuminate here. Is
        this the most important thing in the world? No. But I think it's
        fascinating anyway, and when seeing the Moon during the day has been
        cited as evidence of a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cm97MoyjmPE/?ig_rid=cba7a786-08a8-42ad-bffe-b5fc9814be82" target="_blank">flat Earth</a>,
        perhaps it's a topic worth exploring.

        Moon, or how it came to be in its current state. For a much deeper
        cosmological and astrodynamic angle, I refer you to the brilliant

    <!-- Why does the Moon have phases? -->

    <h2>Why does the Moon have phases?</h2>

    <p>
        Let's begin by examining the phases of the Moon. For the purpose of
        demonstration, we'll use this little model. It's not as pretty as the
        real thing, but it'll do.
    </p>

    <div id="moonPhases" class="sketch-container"></div>

    <p>
        The key to everything lies in the position of the Moon relative to the
        Earth, and the position of the Earth-Moon system relative to the Sun.
        So let's break that down.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Moon revolves around the Earth just about once every four weeks.
        That looks something like this (sizes to scale, distances <i>not</i>
        to scale).
    </p>

    <div id="moonRevolve" class="sketch-container"></div>

    <p>
        Both bodies are illuminated on the same side -- this is due to the
        Sun, which is shining from over 90 million miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
        It probably goes without saying, but note that exactly half of the
        Moon is illuminated at all times, no matter where it is in its orbit
        around the Earth. This tells us that the phases we observe are all a
        matter of perspective. But more on that in a bit -- let's first take a
        moment to define a bit of terminology that we'll need moving forward.
    </p>
    <p>
        The lunar cycle is split into four quarters, beginning and ending
        with the <term>new moon</term>, when the Moon is directly between
        the Earth and the Sun. Click on the sketch below to move the Moon
        between each quarter.
    </p>

    <div id="moonQuarters" class="sketch-container"></div>

    <p>
        Not coincidentally, these are four of the phases of the moon:
        <term>new moon</term>, <term>first quarter</term>,
        <term>full moon</term>, and <term>third quarter</term> (a.k.a.
        <term>last quarter</term>). Perhaps you can already see how these names
        and positions translate to the corresponding Earthbound visuals that
        we're familiar with, but here are four sketches to fully make the
        connection. Try moving the sliders to transition from orbit view to
        Earth view.
    </p>

    <div class="photo-row">
        <div id="quarterView0" class="sketch-container"></div>
        <div id="quarterView1" class="sketch-container"></div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="photo-row">
        <div id="quarterView2" class="sketch-container"></div>
        <div id="quarterView3" class="sketch-container"></div>
    </div>
    <br>

    <p>
    <i>
        Note: the first quarter and third quarter Moon are often referred to
        as <term>half moon</term>, due to the fact that it appears
        half-illuminated as compared to the full moon. This is sometimes
        slightly confusing since the full moon occurs halfway through the
        lunar cycle; but it should remain clear as long as you separate the
        terms describing the lunar orbit (first quarter, etc.) from those
        describing the appearance of the Moon (half moon, etc.).
    </i>
    </p>
    <p>So that's what happens at each quarter. But what happens in between?</p>
    <p>
        Here are four more sketches, very similar to the previous ones. But
        this time, each is frozen at a point between quarters. Note what
        happens now when you lower yourself to Earth.
    </p>

    <div class="photo-row">
        <div id="waxingCrescent" class="sketch-container"></div>
        <div id="waxingGibbous" class="sketch-container"></div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="photo-row">
        <div id="waningGibbous" class="sketch-container"></div>
        <div id="waningCrescent" class="sketch-container"></div>
    </div>
    <br>

    <p>
        These are the in-between phases, which are given two-part names
        according to their shape and their place in the cycle. The thin slice
        of moon is called a <term>crescent</term>, while the not-quite-full
        moon is called a <term>gibbous</term>. To distinguish between the
        crescents and gibbouses, we classify them as either <term>waxing</term>
        (growing towards full moon) or <term>waning</term> (shrinking towards
        new moon). This gives us four new phase names:
        <term>waxing crescent</term>, <term>waxing gibbous</term>,
        <term>waning gibbous</term>, and <term>waning crescent</term>.
    </p>
    <p>Thus, we have all eight phases of the moon.</p>

    <h2>So, we're done...?</h2>

    <p>
        "But wait!"" you may be thinking, "What about the Sun?" And indeed,
        what <i>about</i> the Sun?
    </p>
    <p>
        A keen observer at this point will notice two things (or likely even
        more, but let's focus on these two for now):
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            What about eclipses? Won't the Moon block the Sun at every new
            moon, and/or won't the Earth cast its shadow on the Moon at every
            full moon?
        </li>
        <li>
            What about the daytime? Your little widgets take me down to Earth,
            but they completely ignore whether it's day or night.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Fantastic questions all around. Let's tackle them in this order, just
        because the first one is simpler to answer than the second.

    <!-- What about eclipses? -->

    <h2>What about eclipses?</h2>

    <p>
        An <term>eclipse</term> is when one celestial body passes into the
        shadow of another. On Earth, we experience two main types of eclipses.
    </p>
    <p>
        A <term>lunar eclipse</term> is when the Moon passes into the shadow
        of the Earth; from the perspective of the Earth, the Moon goes dark.
