            We've all seen it, and most people are generally aware that its
            appearance changes according to a periodic cycle. But a peek at
            common Google searches suggests that our nearest celestial neighbor
            is frequently misunderstood.

            What I find exciting is that the answers to 70% of these questions
            lie in a basic understanding of the geometry of the Sun-Earth-Moon
            relationship, so that is what I will attempt to illuminate here. Is
            this the most important thing in the world? No. But I think it's
            fascinating anyway, and when seeing the Moon during the day has been
            cited as evidence of a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cm97MoyjmPE/?ig_rid=cba7a786-08a8-42ad-bffe-b5fc9814be82" target="_blank">flat Earth</a>,
            perhaps it's a topic worth exploring.

        <h2>Why does the Moon have phases?</h2>

        <p>
            Let's begin by examining the phases of the Moon. For the purpose of
            demonstration, we'll use this little model. It's not as pretty as the
            real thing, but it'll do.
        </p>

        <div id="moonPhases" class="sketch-container"></div>

        <p>
            The key to everything lies in the position of the Moon relative to the
            Earth, and the position of the Earth-Moon system relative to the Sun.
            So let's break that down.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Moon revolves around the Earth just about once every four weeks.
            That looks something like this (sizes to scale, distances <i>not</i>
            to scale).
        </p>

        <div id="moonRevolve" class="sketch-container"></div>

        <p>
            Both bodies are illuminated on the same side -- this is due to the
            Sun, which is shining from over 90 million miles away.
        </p>
        <p>
            It probably goes without saying, but note that exactly half of the
            Moon is illuminated at all times, no matter where it is in its orbit
            around the Earth. This tells us that the phases we observe are all a
            matter of perspective. But more on that in a bit -- let's first take a
            moment to define a bit of terminology that we'll need moving forward.
        </p>
        <p>
            The lunar cycle is split into four quarters, beginning and ending
            with the <term>new moon</term>, when the Moon is directly between
            the Earth and the Sun. Click on the sketch below to move the Moon
            between each quarter.
        </p>

        <div id="moonQuarters" class="sketch-container"></div>

        <p>
            Not coincidentally, these are four of the phases of the moon:
            <term>new moon</term>, <term>first quarter</term>,
            <term>full moon</term>, and <term>third quarter</term> (a.k.a.
            <term>last quarter</term>). Perhaps you can already see how these names
            and positions translate to the corresponding Earthbound visuals that
            we're familiar with, but here are four sketches to fully make the
            connection. Try moving the sliders to transition from orbit view to
            Earth view.
        </p>

        <div class="photo-row">
            <div id="quarterView0" class="sketch-container"></div>
            <div id="quarterView1" class="sketch-container"></div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="photo-row">
            <div id="quarterView2" class="sketch-container"></div>
            <div id="quarterView3" class="sketch-container"></div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
        <i>
            Note: the first quarter and third quarter Moon are often referred to
            as <term>half moon</term>, due to the fact that it appears
            half-illuminated as compared to the full moon. This is sometimes
            slightly confusing since the full moon occurs halfway through the
            lunar cycle; but it should remain clear as long as you separate the
            terms describing the lunar orbit (first quarter, etc.) from those
            describing the appearance of the Moon (half moon, etc.).
        </i>
        </p>
        <p>So that's what happens at each quarter. But what happens in between?</p>
        <p>
            Here are four more sketches, very similar to the previous ones. But
            this time, each is frozen at a point between quarters. Note what
            happens now when you lower yourself to Earth.
        </p>

        <div class="photo-row">
            <div id="waxingCrescent" class="sketch-container"></div>
            <div id="waxingGibbous" class="sketch-container"></div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="photo-row">
            <div id="waningGibbous" class="sketch-container"></div>
            <div id="waningCrescent" class="sketch-container"></div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            These are the in-between phases, which are given two-part names
            according to their shape and their place in the cycle. The thin slice
            of moon is called a <term>crescent</term>, while the not-quite-full
            moon is called a <term>gibbous</term>. To distinguish between the
            crescents and gibbouses, we classify them as either <term>waxing</term>
            (growing towards full moon) or <term>waning</term> (shrinking towards
            new moon). This gives us four new phase names:
            <term>waxing crescent</term>, <term>waxing gibbous</term>,
            <term>waning gibbous</term>, and <term>waning crescent</term>.
        </p>
        <p>Thus, we have all eight phases of the moon.</p>

        <p>
            "But wait!"" you may be thinking, "What about the Sun?" And indeed,
            what <i>about</i> the Sun?

        <p>
            A keen observer at this point will notice two things (or likely even
            more, but let's focus on these two for now):
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                What about eclipses? Won't the Moon block the Sun at every new
                moon, and/or won't the Earth cast its shadow on the Moon at every
                full moon?
            </li>
            <li>
                What about the daytime? Your little widgets take me down to Earth,
                but they completely ignore whether it's day or night.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Fantastic questions all around. Let's tackle them in this order, just
            because the first one is simpler to answer than the second.
        </p>

        <!-- What about eclipses? -->

        <h2>What about eclipses?</h2>

        <p>
            An <term>eclipse</term> is when one celestial body passes into the
            shadow of another. On Earth, we experience two main types of eclipses.
        </p>
        <p>
            A <term>lunar eclipse</term> is when the Moon passes into the shadow
            of the Earth; from the perspective of the Earth, the Moon goes dark.
        </p>

        <div id="lunarEclipse" class="sketch-container"></div>
        <br>

        <p>
            A <term>solar eclipse</term> is when the Earth passes under the
            shadow of the Moon; from the perspective of the Earth, the sun
            becomes blocked from view.
        </p>

        <div id="solarEclipse" class="sketch-container"></div>
        <br>

        <p>
            Take a look at this setup of the Sun, Earth, and Moon.
        </p>

        <div id="allEcliptic" class="sketch-container"></div>
        <br>

        <p>
            If you play with the slider, you'll see that all of the movement is
            happening in the same plane -- specifically, the plane defined by the
            orbit of the Earth around the Sun. We call this the
            <term>ecliptic plane</term>, and it's shown here in blue. If the orbit
            of the Moon lay exactly in the ecliptic plane as shown, then every new
            and full moon would bring a solar and lunar eclipse, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            In reality, nothing is so perfectly aligned. The Moon's orbital plane
            lies tilted at a 5° angle from the ecliptic plane, so the three
            bodies don't usually line up perfectly enough for an eclipse to
            happen. But it is important to note that while not every full moon
            brings a lunar eclipse, the full moon is still the only phase in which
            a lunar eclipse <i>can</i> occur. The same relationship exists between
            solar eclipses and the new moon.
        </p>

        <div id="moonTilt" class="sketch-container"></div>
        <br>

        <p>
        <i>
            Note: This sketch exaggerates the Moon's orbital tilt to 20°, just to
            illustrate the point. Though the true tilt is much smaller, the greater
            distances involved mean that eclipses of all kinds are far less common
            than this sketch would make it seem.
        </i>
        </p>
        <p>
            In any case, wow are we lucky that these sometimes line up, because the
            results are breathtaking.

        <p>Extra notes on eclipses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                During a lunar eclipse (especially a total lunar eclipse), the bending
                of sunlight through the Earth's atmosphere turns the moon a
                reddish-orange color, often called a <term>blood moon</term>.
                <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/lunar-eclipse-guide-what-they-are-when-to-see-them-and-where.html" target="_blank">
                    Read more about lunar eclipses here.</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Our solar eclipses are a special miracle. The Moon is about 400 times
                smaller than the Sun, but the Sun is just about 400 times farther away.
                The result is that from our perspective on Earth, the two bodies appear
                almost exactly the same size. This has a massive effect on the
                spectacular visual of the Sun's corona that we experience during a
                total solar eclipse: if the sizes or distances were shifted just a
                little bit, we'd either never get full coverage of the Sun, or the much
                larger Moon would simply blot out the corona.
            </li>
            <li>
                We actually do have solar eclipses without full coverage of the Sun;
                these are called <term>annular solar eclipses</term>, and they're
                beautiful in their own right (see upper-right image above). This
                happens due to the fact that the Moon's orbit is not perfectly circular
                -- a detail that we're skipping in this page for the sake of simplicity.

        <h2>What about the daytime?</h2>

        <p>
            Our final topic is potentially the most confusing, and was actually the
            primary inspiration for creating this page. I've often been asked by
            friends and family questions along the lines of: "Where is the Moon
            tonight?" or "Why can I see the Moon during the day?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, surprise, surprise -- these also come down to a discussion of the
            lunar cycle. But it'll take slightly more careful thought to understand
            the direct relationship between the phase of the Moon and when it's visible
            in the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's begin by anchoring our thinking in the two easiest phases to
            understand: new moon and full moon.
        </p>
        <p>
            At new moon, the Moon is in the same part of the sky as the Sun, with its
            dark side facing towards the Earth. Thus, with the exception of a solar
            eclipse, there is nothing for us to see either by day when the Moon is out
            with the Sun, or by night when the Moon is below the horizon.
        </p>

        <div id="timeViewNew" class="sketch-container"></div>
        <br>

        <p>
            Take a close look at this sketch. The little red sphere represents
            a person on Earth, and the yellow circle represents the horizon from that
            person's perspective. This person begins the sketch at midnight, when
            they are on the side of the Earth directly opposite the Sun. They obviously
            can't see anything in the sky that's below their horizon since that would
            be looking through the Earth, but they can see everything above the horizon
            -- which in this case corresponds to everything on the non-Earth side of
            the yellow circle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Move the slider to rotate the Earth, shifting the scene forward in time.
            Note that the sun comes into the field of view right around 6:00 AM, which
            is also when the person crosses onto the lit side of the Earth -- this
            is sunrise. As the day continues until sunset, the Moon is within the
            person's field of view the entire time, but it's invisible because they
            are faced with its dark side.
        </p>
        <p>
            The opposite happens during full moon.
        </p>

        <div id="timeViewFull" class="sketch-container"></div>
        <br>

        <p>
            This time, the person starts out at noon, but does not see the Moon until
            around 6:00 PM (sunset) because it is directly opposite the Sun. Now, as
            time moves forward, the Moon is within the field of view throughout the
            entire night, and is visible because its light side is facing the Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
            From these two extremes we learn:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                At new moon, the Moon is up for 12 hours, from sunrise to
                sunset, but it is invisible.
            </li>
            <li>
                At full moon, the Moon is up for 12 hours, from sunset to
                sunrise, and it is visible.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Extrapolating from here, we can assume that for any point in the
            lunar cycle between these two, as long as the lunar phase is far
            enough from new moon for the Moon to be visible from Earth, there
            will always a 12-hour subset of the 24-hour day during which the
            Moon is in the sky.

                        It's 9 AM, so the Sun is already high in the sky.

                        You are looking east, so the Moon is rising -- only a waxing
                        moon rises during the day.

                        A first quarter Moon would rise at noon, so this is before

                What is (most likely) the least-seen phase of the Moon (excluding

                    Waning gibbous. Rises ~9:00 PM and sets ~9:00 AM, aligning most
                    closely with regular sleeping hours.

                        It's okay to disagree with this answer, as long as you can
                        back up your position.

                    <li>
                        But any waxing phase is almost certainly incorrect, due to
                        the fact that the waxing moon is up during the day.

        <h3>Notes</h3>

        <p>
            The simulations on this page made some assumptions for the sake of
            simplicity. None of these affect the fundamental concepts as presented,
            but here they are.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                All orbits are assumed circular. In reality, orbits are elliptical.
            </li>
            <li>
                Relatedly, the Earth-Moon system is not purely a matter of the Moon
                orbiting the Earth, but rather of both bodies orbiting their
                collective center of mass. This also applies when the Sun is brought
                into the picture, but with infinitesimally small effect.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Earth's equatorial plane is pictured as aligned with the ecliptic
                plane, when it should really be at a 23.4° tilt. I mostly ignored this
                because each body is rendered as a collection of longitudinal slices,
                and I didn't want to deal with the lighting ramifications of a tilted
                Earth. Similar things can be said about the Sun and the Moon.
            </li>
            <li>
                All Earthbound views of the Moon are shown as seen from the Northern
                Hemisphere. Views from the Southern Hemisphere would be reversed
                (e.g., a waxing crescent would begin illuminating on the left side).
            </li>
            <li>
                Relatedly, the exact timing of moonrise/set (as well as sunrise/set)
                varies widely based on season and latitude. Technically, the sketches
                shown on this page assume a view from the equator, on either of the
                equinoxes -- yet still from the Northern Hemisphere.
            </li>
