            <h2>So, we're done...?</h2>

            <p>
                "But wait!"" you may be thinking, "What about the Sun?" And indeed,
                what <i>about</i> the Sun?
            </p>
            <p>
                A keen observer at this point will notice two things (or likely even
                more, but let's focus on these two for now):
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    What about eclipses? Won't the Moon block the Sun at every new
                    moon, and/or won't the Earth cast its shadow on the Moon at every
                    full moon?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What about the daytime? Your little widgets take me down to Earth,
                    but they completely ignore whether it's day or night.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Fantastic questions all around. Let's tackle them in this order, just
                because the first one is simpler to answer than the second.
            </p>
        </>
